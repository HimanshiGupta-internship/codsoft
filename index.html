        <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
            <p>We help individuals achieve a balanced and healthier life with expert guidance.
                Initially, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare consisted of two departments, each led by a Secretary
                of the Government of India: the Department of Health and Family Welfare and the Department of Health
                Research. On August 7, 2014, through an extraordinary gazette notification, the Department of AIDS Control
                was merged with the Department of Health and Family Welfare and is now known as the National AIDS Control
                Organization (NACO).
